# meanpractice

##Description
This repo will be used to test-run a local MEAN stack project following the following tutorials:
[hackhands](https://hackhands.com/how-to-get-started-on-the-mean-stack/)

##Instructions
These instructions will be used as notes on what I've done to get this working on Mac OS X Yosemite.

###Installation
####MongoDB
1. Visit [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org/downloads) and download the Mac OS X version.
2. Extract the file. You can do this with this command:
```
tar -zxvf mongodb-osx-x86_64-3.4.2.tgz
```
*Common sense check: if this isn't working, check to make sure your terminal is at the correct directory, and the file name matches before consulting the interwebs for their infinite knowledge*
